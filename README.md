1.If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a function multiples, it should take in a single integer parameter. The function should print out the sum of the multiples as described above.

2.Write a function called hasThree or has_three that takes 2 positive integers as input. If either of the numbers is 3 and the sum of the numbers contains a 3 then return a boolean true. Otherwise, return false. Make sure you know what a boolean is, if you return a string then that would be incorrect. Remember to choose the best function name for the language you are working in.
